            <h3>Python Programming</h3>
            <p> As its a all arounder programming language which is next to Java code, used in multiple fields and for multiple purposes and user friendly. This is an interpreted language so if any error occured can be easily sorted out unlike Java where
                you have to compile entire code only then you will get proper output.</p>
